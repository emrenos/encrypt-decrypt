# Caesar Cipher :lock::key:

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encoding and decoding messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts text by shifting letters by a given number.
- Decrypts text by reversing the shift.

## Usage
- **Direction**: Type `encode` to encrypt or `decode` to decrypt.
- **Message**: The text you want to encode or decode.
- **Shift Number**: The number of positions by which you want to shift the letters.

## Example
```sh
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
The encoded text is mjqqt

Type 'yes' to want to go again, type 'no' to want to quit. 
no
Thanks for using Caesar Cipher!
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
cd caesar-cipher
```

## Upcoming Updates
1. **GUI Integration**: The next update will introduce an interface that allows users to perform encryption and decryption operations via GUI instead of terminal.
2. **Advanced Encryption Method**: The encryption method will be upgraded from the Caesar Cipher to a more sophisticated algorithm to enhance security.
